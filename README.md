# FATZ

**FATZ**: from arXiv to Zotero. Automatically translate papers into Chinese & save them to your Zotero library.

### Installation

You need to create a `config.json` file **manually**;
Here's an example:

```json
{
  "zotero": {
    "library_id": "0000000",
    "api_key": "****************"
  },
  "convertapi": {
    "api_credentials": "secret_************"
  }
}
```

You can find your personal keys in [Zotero API](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security) and [ConvertAPI](https://www.convertapi.com/a/api/html-to-pdf).
